Steps:
•	Divide the input into blocks of size = sqrt(input length)
•	Calculate the sum of each block
•	In the given range do the following steps:
    o	Find the sum of elements from start range to the blocks to the overlapped block
    o	Find the sum of overlapped blocks
    o	Find the sum of elements in end blocks of range
•	Return the sum of elements

Complexity:
  1) Calculating sum of each block -> O(n)
  2) Finding sum of range:
      1) start range: Maximum complexity is O(sqrt n) in worst case
      2) end range: Maximum complexity is O(sqrt n) in worst case
      3) sum of overlapped block: Maximum complexity is O(sqrt n) in worst case
      total complexity is: 3 * O(sqrt n) in worst case
  3) space:
        need extra sqrt(n) space
